# Using InfinityOne on Windows

InfinityOne has a Windows client, compatible with Windows versions 7, 8 and 10; it is identical in
functionality to the InfinityOne web application. The client
can be download through the [InfinityOne website](https://infintiyoneframework.org/).

The client is regularly updated and is a wrapper of the web application, but with enhanced
notifications and can run in the background. The current version does not contain
any significant features additional to those in the web application.

    **Note:** Since InfinityOne is no longer running on a browser, many external keyboard shortcuts
    endemic to a browser will no longer work, for example, ALT-LEFT to go back to the previous page.

## Connecting to a server

When you open the InfinityOne client for the first time, you will come across a screen
asking for your organizations's server address on InfinityOne. Enter your organization's
address and press the **Connect** button.

!!! warn ""
    There's no need to add `https://` in the case that your server is running a secure
    HTTP (HTTPS) protocol.
